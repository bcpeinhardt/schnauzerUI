# Introduction

SchnauzerUI is a human readable DSL for performing automated UI testing in the browser. 
The main goal of SchnauzerUI is to increase stakeholder visibility and participation in automated Quality Assurance testing. 
Rather than providing a shim to underling code written by a QA engineer (see Cucumber), SchnauzerUI is the only source of truth for a test's execution. 
In this way, SchnauzerUI aims to provide a test report you can trust.
