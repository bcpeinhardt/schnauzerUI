# schnauzerUI

SchnauzerUI is a human readable DSL for performing automated UI testing in the browser.
The main goal of SchnauzerUI is to increase stakeholder visibility and participation in
automated Quality Assurance testing.

Rather than providing a shim to underling code written by
a QA engineer (see [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)), SchnauzerUI is the only source of truth for a
test's execution. In this way, SchnauzerUI aims to provide a test report you can trust.

SchnauzerUI is most comparable to and could serve as an open source replacement for [testRigor](https://testrigor.com/)

If you would like to try it out, you can start with the [narrative docs](https://bcpeinhardt.github.io/schnauzerUI/)
or watch this intro youtube video (not yet filmed, sorry).
