# Say goodbye to maintaining huge automated test suites. <br>

### *SchnauzerUI rescues you from the burden of maintaining huge automated*
### *test suites by being so productive to write, starting from scratch isn't*
### *a bad thing.* <br><br>

### *Every SchnauzerUI script is completely standalone. Paste one in a jira ticket, slack/teams message, or even* 
### *a text! Automated testing doesn't have to be limited to rigid regression suites only engineers understand.* <br><br>

### *What makes SchnauzerUI so productive?*
- ### *REPL driven development brings exploratory and automated testing together*
- ### *Easily inline existing scripts to achieve reusability while creating a script that runs by itself*
- ### *Smart locators empower you to think in terms of the UI instead of the HTML*
- ### *Scripts are completely framework agnostic, so they'll survive a framework migration*
- ### *Launch a browser and start automating with a single command*
